### The Cake Shop Website Redesign
This project involved redesigning an outdated bakery website to improve usability, mobile responsiveness, and SEO performance. The original site had over 45 cluttered pages, lacked a shopping cart, and was poorly optimized for both desktop and mobile users. The redesigned version consolidates content into a streamlined structure with five main pages, introduces a functional cart system, and applies modern UI/UX and SEO best practices.
#### Main Pages
1. [Homepage](https://jjennyzs.github.io/cake-website-redesign/index.html) – Navigation bar and general menu
2. Menu: [Valentines](https://jjennyzs.github.io/cake-website-redesign/valentines.html) – Product detail page for seasonal cakes
3. Menu: [Pizza Cake](https://jjennyzs.github.io/cake-website-redesign/pizza-cake.html) – Product detail page for specialty cakes
4. [Contact Us](https://jjennyzs.github.io/cake-website-redesign/contact.html) – Inquiry form and custom order options
5. [Cart](https://jjennyzs.github.io/cake-website-redesign/cart.html) – Checkout functionality with price calculation

> ⚠️ Note: From the menu bar, only the “Valentine’s” and “Pizza Cake” pages were implemented during the project. Other product pages were structured in the design and intended to follow the same format, but were not developed due to the defined project scope.
